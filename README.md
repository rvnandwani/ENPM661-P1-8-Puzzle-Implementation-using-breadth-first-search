by using brute force search algorithm (BFS).  
## Instructions to run the code  
1. Input must be given in form of a matrix where number 0 represents empty cell  
2. Enter the initial node row wise with a space between each element of the row and all elements must be either (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) without any repetition and press enter key after inserting every row  
3. Check puzzle solvablity I used this algorithm - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/
